<h2>介绍</h2>
<h3><a class="section" name="about-this-tutorial">关于本教程</a></h3>

<p>这是趣学Erlang的开篇介绍，阅读本教程也许是你学习Erlang的一个开始</p>

<img class="left" src="static/img/erlang.png" width="132" height="112" alt="Erlang logo" />

<p>首先我有这个想法是因为我阅读了利波瓦卡(Miran Lipovača)的 <a class="external" href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/" title="Free Book!">趣学Haskell(LYAH)</a> 教程；
	我认为他做的工作充分的展示了语言的美丽，同时让语言学习过程更加友好。 由于我和他很熟识，我曾问他，我来写Erlang的版本如何。 他感觉这主意不错，并且他本人对Erlang也有一些兴趣。</p>

<p>所以我开始编写这个教程。 当然我写本教程还有其它动机：主要我发现语言入门有点困难(要么使用文档稀缺的网站或者你买一本书), 并且我认为像趣学Haskell的那种入门指南是对社区有益处的。
	更重要的是, 我见过好多人，都是通过非常笼统的言论过度的称赞或贬低Erlang。之后就有人认为Erlang只不过是一个噱头。如果我想通过别的方式说服这些人，我认为是不会很快受到这些人的关注。</p>

<p>希望本书成为有命令式语言编程基础(如 C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, 等) 和那些知道或不知道函数式编程的 (Haskell, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, OCaml...)的人的入门指南。
	我也希望也一本没有偏见的书，阐述Erlang是什么，它的有点和它的缺点都是什么。</p>


<h3><a class="section" name="what-is-erlang">什么是Erlang</a></h3>
<p>首先，Erlang是一门函数式语言。 If you have ever worked with imperative languages, statements such as <code>i++</code> may be normal to you; 如果你使用过命令式开发语言编译器，像 <code>i++</code> 这样的语句对你来说是比较常见了。
	in functional programming they are not allowed.  而这些语句在函数式开发中是不允许的。In fact, changing the value of any variable is strictly forbidden! 事实上，改变任何变量的值是强烈禁止的！This may sound weird at first, but if you remember your math classes, it's in fact how you've learned it:  这看起来有点古怪。 只是，如果你想想起你的数学课程，这就是事实中你曾经学习过的：</p>
<pre class="brush:eshell">
y = 2
x = y + 3
x = 2 + 3
x = 5
</pre>
<p>Had I added the following: 下面我作的加法：</p>
<pre class="brush:eshell">
x = 5 + 1
x = x
&there4; 5 = 6
</pre>
<p>You would have been very confused.  你将会觉十分困惑。Functional programming recognizes this 函数式编程是这样认为的: If I say <var>x</var> is 5, then I can't logically claim it is also 6!  如果我说 变量 <var>x</var> 的值是 5， 那么就不能从逻辑上声称变量 <var>x</var> 的值同时是6.  This would be dishonest.    这将是？？不诚实的？。 This is also why a function with the same parameter should always return the same result: 同时这也就是为什么一个函数在输入同样的参数将总是返回同样的结果。</p>
<pre class="brush:eshell">
x = add_two_to(3) = 5
&there4; x = 5
</pre>
<p>Functions always returning the same result for the same parameter is called referential transparency. 函数对相同的输入参数总是返回相同的结果，这被称为引用透明性。  It's what lets us replace <code>add_two_to(3)</code> with 5, as the result of <code>3+2</code> will always be 5.   在我们将代码<code>add_tow_to(3)</code> 替换为 5， 结果将永远是 5.   That means we can then glue dozens of functions together in order to resolve more complex problems while being sure nothing will break.  这意味着我们可以将多个函数组合在一起来解决复杂的问题，并且可以预测在解决问题过程中没什么被破坏。 Logical and clean isn't it?  这是不是合乎逻辑并且很清晰呢。 There's a problem though: 然而下面这个例子就有问题了：</p>
<pre class="brush:eshell">
x = today() = 2009/10/22
  -- wait a day --
x = today() = 2009/10/23
x = x
&there4; 2009/10/22 = 2009/10/23
</pre>
<p>Oh no! My beautiful equations! 哦，不，这美丽的问题。 They suddenly all turned wrong!  他们突然全变成错误了。How come my function returns a different result every day?  我的函数在每一天都返回不同的结果，为什么！</p>
<p>Obviously, there are some cases where it's useful to break referential transparency. 很明显，破坏引用透明性在某些场景（用例）下是很有用的。  Erlang has this very pragmatic approach with functional programming: obey its purest principles (referential transparency, avoiding mutable data, etc), but break away from them when real world problems pop up.</p>

<img class="right" src="static/img/envelope.png" width="206" height="161" alt="An envelope" />

<p>Now, we defined Erlang as a functional programming language, but there's also a large emphasis on concurrency and high reliability. To be able to have dozens of tasks being performed at the same time, Erlang uses the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" title="A more technical definition">actor model</a>, and each actor is a separate process in the virtual machine. In a nutshell, if you were an actor in Erlang's world, you would be a lonely person, sitting in a dark room with no window, waiting by your mailbox to get a message. Once you get a message, you react to it in a specific way: you pay the bills when receiving them, you respond to Birthday cards with a "Thank you" letter and you ignore the letters you can't understand.</p>

<p>Erlang's actor model can be imagined as a world where everyone is sitting alone in their own room and can perform a few distinct tasks. Everyone communicates strictly by writing letters and that's it. While it sounds like a boring life (and a new age for the postal service), it means you can ask many people to perform very specific tasks for you, and none of them will ever do something wrong or make mistakes which will have repercussions on the work of others; they may not even know the existence of people other than you (and that's great).</p>
<p>To escape this analogy, Erlang forces you to write actors (processes) that will share no information with other bits of code unless they pass messages to each other. Every communication is explicit, traceable and safe.</p>

<p>When we defined Erlang, we did so at a language level, but in a broader sense, this is not all there is to it: Erlang is also a development environment as a whole. The code is compiled to bytecode and runs inside a virtual machine. So Erlang, much like Java and kids with ADD, can run anywhere. The standard distribution includes (among others) development tools (compiler, debugger, profiler, test framework), the Open Telecom Platform (OTP) Framework, a web server, a parser generator, and the mnesia database, a key-value storage system able to replicate itself on many servers, supporting nested transactions and letting you store any kind of Erlang data.</p>
<p>The VM and the libraries also allow you to update the code of a running system without interrupting any program, distribute your code with ease on many computers and manage errors and faults in a simple but powerful manner.</p>

<img class="right" src="static/img/letitcrash.png" width="206" height="320" alt="A crashed plane" title="Don't do this" />

<p>We'll see how to use most of these tools and achieve safety later on, but for now, I'll tell you about a related general policy in Erlang: Let it crash. Not like a plane with dozens of passengers dying, but more like a tightrope walker with a safety net under him. While you should avoid making mistakes, you won't need to check for every type or error condition in most cases.</p>

<p>Erlang's ability to recover from errors, organize code with actors and making it scale with distribution and concurrency all sound awesome, which brings us to the next section...</p>

<h3><a class="section" name="kool-aid">Don't drink too much Kool-Aid</a></h3>

<p>There may be many little yellowish-orange sections named like this one around the book (you'll recognize them when you see them). Erlang is currently gaining lots of popularity due to zealous talks which may lead people to believe it's more than what it really is. These reminders will be there to help you keep your feet on the ground if you're one of these overenthusiastic learners.</p>

<p>The first case of this is related to Erlang's massive scaling abilities due to its lightweight processes. It is true that Erlang processes are very light:  you can have hundreds of thousands of them existing at the same time, but this doesn't mean you have to use it that way just because you can. For example, creating a shooter game where everything including bullets is its own actor is madness. The only thing you'll shoot with a game like this is your own foot.  There is still a small cost in sending a message from actor to actor, and if you divide tasks too much, <em>you will make things slower</em>!</p>

<p>I'll cover this with more depth when we're far enough into the learning to actually worry about it, but just keep in mind that randomly throwing parallelism at a problem is not enough to make it go fast. Don't be sad; there are times when using hundreds of processes will both be possible and useful! It's just not happening all the time.</p>

<p>Erlang is also said to be able to scale in a directly proportional manner to how many cores your computer has, but this is usually not true: <img class="left" src="static/img/scaling.png" width="220" height="185" alt="Bad Graph: Speed vs Cores: It just scales!" />
it is possible, but most problems do not behave in a way that lets you just run everything at the same time.</p>

<p>There's something else to keep in mind: while Erlang does some things very well, it's technically still possible to get the same results from other languages. The opposite is also true; evaluate each problem as it needs to be, and choose the right tool according to the problem being addressed. Erlang is no silver bullet and will be particularly bad at things like image and signal processing, operating system device drivers, etc. and will shine at things like large software for server use (i.e.: queues, map-reduce), doing some lifting coupled with other languages, higher-level protocol implementation, etc. Areas in the middle will depend on you. You should not necessarily wall yourself in server software with Erlang: there have been cases of people doing unexpected and surprising things. One example is IANO, a robot created by the UNICT team, which uses Erlang for its artificial intelligence and won the silver medal at the 2009 <a class="external" href="http://eurobot.dmi.unict.it/">eurobot competition</a>. Another example is Wings 3D, an open source 3D modeler (but not a renderer) written in Erlang and thus cross-platform.</p>


<h3><a class="section" name="what-you-need">What you need to dive in</a></h3>
<p>All you need to get started is a text editor and the Erlang environment. You can get the source code and the Windows binaries from <a class="external" href="http://erlang.org/download.html" title="official Erlang download page">the official Erlang website</a>. I won't go into much installation details, but for Windows, just download and run the binary files. Don't forget to add your Erlang directory to your <var>PATH</var> system variable to be able to access it from the command line.</p>

<p>On Debian-based Linux distributions, you should be able to install the package by doing <code>$ apt-get install erlang</code>. On Fedora (if you have 'yum' installed), you can achieve the same by typing <code># yum install erlang</code>. However, these repositories often hold outdated versions of the Erlang packages; Using an outdated version could give you some differences with what you'll get from this tutorial and a hit in performance with certain applications. I thus encourage you to compile from source. Consult the README file within the package and Google to get all the installing details you'll need, they'll do a far better job than I ever will.</p>

<p>On FreeBSD, many options are available to you. If you're using portmaster, you can do <code>portmaster lang/erlang</code>. For standard ports, it should be <code>cd /usr/ports/lang/erlang; make install clean</code>. Finally, if you want to use packages, run <code>pkg_add -rv erlang</code>.</p>

<p>If you're on OSX, you can install Erlang with <code>$ brew install erlang</code> (with <a class="external" href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew">Homebrew</a>) or by doing <code>$ port install erlang</code> (if you prefer <a class="external" href="http://macports.org">MacPorts</a>.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, Erlang Solutions Ltd. offers <a class="external" href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads">packages for all major OSes</a>, which generally work pretty well.</p>

<div class="note">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> at the time of this writing, I'm using Erlang version R13B+, so for best results, you should use that version or newer ones.</p>
</div>


<h3><a class="section" name="get-help">Where to get Help</a></h3>
<p>There are a few places where you can get help. If you're using linux, you can access the man pages for good technical documentation. Erlang has a lists module (which we'll soon see): to get the documentation on lists, just type in <code>$ erl -man lists</code>.</p>

<p>On Windows, the installation should include HTML documentation. You can download it at any time from the <a class="external" href="http://erlang.org/doc/" title="Official Erlang HTML documentation">official erlang site</a>, or consult one of the <a class="external" href="http://erldocs.com/" title="Unofficial Erlang HTML documentation">cleaner alternative sites</a>.</p>

<p>Good coding practices can be found <a class="external" href="http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml">here</a> once you feel you need to get everything clean. The code in this book will attempt to follow these guidelines, too.</p>

<p>Now, there are times where just getting the technical details isn't enough. When that happens, I tend to turn to two main sources: the official <a class="external" href="http://www.erlang.org/static/doc/mailinglist.html">mailing list</a> (you should follow it just to learn a bunch) and the <a class="external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net/erlang">#erlang</a> channel on <a class="external" href="http://freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>.</p>

<p>Oh and if you're the type of person to go for cookbooks and pre-made recipes, <a class="external" href="http://trapexit.org/" title="trapexit, an Erlang community site">trapexit</a> is the place you're looking for. They also mirror the mailing lists as a forum and a general wiki, which can always be helpful.</p>
